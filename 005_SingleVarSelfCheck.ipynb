    "This is useful becuase there's very little guidance, so you'll need to figure out what to do on your own. Looking forward, one of the primary reasons that we need to know this stuff for machine learning is something called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), which is usually the first step in doing machine learning stuff. We take whatever data we're using, load it up, and look through it to see if anything is wrong, weird, useful, or interersting. This helps us prepare our data for the ML work, to make things as accurate and reliable as possible. This little bit is kind of part 1 of EDA that you'll need to do later on.\n",
