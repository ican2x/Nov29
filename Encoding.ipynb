    "\n",
    "For example, the linear regression algorithm generates a predictive model in the format: Y = slope * X + intercept. If that X value is a categorical value like hair color, it makes no sense to calculate slope * haricolor. (Note: categorical values don't really make sense in a regression with only one varaible).\n",
