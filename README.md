# BasicClassExamples

This repository will hold a bunch of smaller and ad-hoc examples that we work through and talk through in class. 

These stand to be changed, added, or removed as we work through the different topics in class, depending on what we may need to spend more time on, questions from students, or concepts that need further explaination. 

This is also a good place where you can try any GitHub related things with no worries, if you break your repository somehow, just reclone this one.
